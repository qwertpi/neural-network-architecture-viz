# neural-network-architecture-viz
![An example output of the program](Image_1.png?raw=true)  
Some code using python turtle that generates images of feed forward neural network architectures because all the connections look really cool when there is a sufficient number of them

## Some example outputs
![An example output of the program](Image_1.png?raw=true)

![Another example output of the program](Image_2.png?raw=true)

![Getting quite dense now](Image_3.png?raw=true)

![Even more dense now](Image_4.png?raw=true)

![Mega-dense and mega-awesome](Image_5.png?raw=true)
## Usage 
Simply change the architecture list to reflect the numbers of neurons you want on each layer then run, the deafult speed 0 is the fastest but speed(10) is only one step down from this in terms of speed and therefore is a good setting if you wish to see what the code is doing
